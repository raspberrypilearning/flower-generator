## Save your images

When you create an image you like, you can save it and use it in another Scratch project, as a screensaver, or on a website.

When there is an image on the Stage that you like, right-click it and then click on **save image as**

**Note:** on some computers or browsers, the menu option for saving your image may be named differently.
