## Save your patterns

When you create a pattern you like, you can save it and use it in another Scratch project, as a screensaver, or on a website.

When you have a pattern on the Stage that you like, you can right-click it and then click on **save picture of stage** 

**Note:** on some computers, you need to hold down the <kbd>shift</kbd> key while you right-click.
