## Challenge: Create a flower design

Can you use your `draw flower`{:class="blockmoreblocks"} block several times to draw more flowers and create an interesting design? Drawing different flowers at the same location creates an interesting effect.  

+ Create a design that you like. Here's an example:

Need a reminder on how coordinates work in Scratch?

[[[generic-scratch-coordinates]]]

You don't have to use petals shaped like ellipses. This 'firework' pattern was created using a thick straight line and a black backdrop:

The 'petal' is just a line with the crosshair a bit below the bottom:

+ Experiment with adding new petal costumes and see what you can come up with. 

+ What happens if you try out a shape which is not filled in, such as a square?
